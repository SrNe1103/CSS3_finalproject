                <h2 id="content">Cancer</h2>
                <p>Cancer is a genetic disease in wich some cells from the own body divide without control. Those cells eventually spread into other tissues, damaging the normal functions of the body.</p>
                <p>Cancer can be described with the diferences between Cancer and Normal cells:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Growing in absence of signals</li>
                    <li>Ignores apoptotic (programmed cell death) signals</li>
                    <li>Capability to metastasize (spread to other tissues)</li>
                    <li>Hide from the immune system</li>
                    <li>Induce blood vessel growth nerby the tumor</li>
                </ul>
                <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/what-is-cancer" class="reference">(2025, NIH)</a>
                <p>The way to treat this disease looks forward to kill the cancer cells. To do that, it's necessary to differentiate the cancer and normal cells. It's specially hard to treat this disease, because it's originated from the cells of the own body.</p>

                <figcaption>The tumor microenviroment gives cancer particular features. The fibroblast recruitment produce a supporting stroma. Epithelial to mesenchimal transition enables cancer metastasis. Angiogenesis (abnormal vessel growth) brings nutrients and oxigen to the tumor. Finally, immune evasion enables the tumor to resist the own's body immune response.</figcaption>

            <h2>Main treatment strategies</h2>
            <p>In order to treat this disease, a number of medical advances have been developed. They can be divided in local and systemic treatments.</p> <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types.html" class="reference">(American Cancer Society, 2025)</a>

                <h3>Local treatments</h3>
                <p>This type of treatments are specific to a tumor or area of the body that is affected with cancer. Local treatments are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Surgery</li>
                        <li>Radiation</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                <h3>Systemic treatments</h3>
                <p>Systemic treatments can affect the whole body, wich make them less specific but more useful for metastazised cancers. Systemic treatments are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Chemotherapy</li>
                        <li>Immunotherapy</li>
                        <li>Targeted therapy</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
            </section>
            <p>Usually a combination of the mentioned treatments are applied to ensure better results. Also, new technologies are showing promising results. Hopefully, in the near future, there will be even more chances of cure this disease for everyone.</p>
